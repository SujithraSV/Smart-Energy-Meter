## 📌 Overview

The Smart Energy Meter is a GUI-based Python application that simulates voltage and current readings, calculates power consumption, and displays the data in real-time. It features:
- 📉 **power usage graphs**
- ⚠️ **Fraud detection for abnormal usage**
- 🔔 **Alert system** for notifying users about sudden spikes

This tool promotes energy awareness, system integrity, and user-friendly monitoring — ideal for smart homes or future IoT integration.

## 🧠 My Role

- Set up and executed the full Python project in VS Code  
- Debugged runtime and syntax issues for seamless functioning  
- Analyzed and understood the working of fraud detection logic and alert mechanisms  
- Worked on the graph plotting functionality using `matplotlib`  
- Explained all components (code logic, GUI behavior, alert system) to teammates during presentation prep  
- Gained real-world insight into GUI apps and energy monitoring solutions
